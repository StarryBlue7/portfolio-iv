            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                While completing my Bachelor's of Science in chemistry, I was
                additionally trained in graphic design, Python, and
                computational chemistry.
            </p>
            <p>
                This led quickly into working for a web-based cloud biotech
                company, where my software development skills were further
                refined, and I found a true love of the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, to properly pursue a developer career, I completed a
                full-stack web development course at UC Berkeley Extension,
                where I was shortly after hired to stay on as an instructional
                specialist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've since been applying my proficiency in quickly picking up
                new frameworks and effective technical communication to
                teaching, advising, and debugging alongside hundreds of students
                across multiple course cohorts from varying socioeconomic
                backgrounds and technical proficiencies.
