            <p>
                Having grown up with an innate love for science and technology,
                I've found a natural fit in diverse STEM roles, ranging from
                analytical lab research to cloud biotech SaaS to computer
                science education.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the skills I've developed in software development and lab
                sciences, I have additionally studied graphic design, data
                analytics, responsive/accessible design, and SEO.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently applying my proficiency in quickly picking up new
                frameworks and effective technical communication to teaching,
                advising, and debugging alongside hundreds of students across
                varying socioeconomic backgrounds and technical proficiencies.
