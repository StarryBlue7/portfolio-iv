            <p>
                Having grown up in a household of web developers, web design has always been a part of my life, if only at times as side projects here and there.
                Even while pursuing a degree in chemistry, I was additionally trained in graphic design, Python, and computational chemistry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, as luck would have it, I ended up working for a web-based cloud biotech company, where development skills were once again at the forefront.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, why fight the inevitable? I'm now pursing a career in web and software development.
